# HoubyStudio.LazyAdmin.App

## Overview

The Desktop project contains the code for your app. The `App.xaml.cs` file defines an `Application` class that represents your app instance. The `MainWindow.xaml.cs` file defines a MainWindow class that represents the main window displayed by your app instance. The classes derive from types in the `Microsoft.UI.Xaml` namespace of WinUI.
